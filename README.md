# IoTricks
This tutorial is part of the Internet of Tricks Erasmus+ Project. By the end of the tutorial, you will create a GPS Monitoring Device that can track users in almost real-time. The device has pedagogical purposes and is designed to increase user awareness of the dangers of connecting devices in an IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystem.
